# WorkSamples

This repo contains a few of the files and code snippets of some of the projects on which I have worked recently.

1. ISAPI folder: A REST web service implemented utilizing WCF in order to expose some of the business logic through Sharepoint. This folder contains a Service contract, its implementation and the web service's configuration.
2. GreenButton folder: To integrate with the implementation of GreenButton's REST APIs from London Hydro and Hydro One ([What is GreenButton?](http://www.greenbuttondata.org/)). This included the integration with providers' oAuth implementation, downloading and processing the consumption data periodically, and converting it to meaningful reports for our consumers.
